            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              I'm Valerio, <strong>Backend Developer & Bitcoin enthusiast</strong> who loves 
              intuitive, clean and modern technologies development and design.
            </p>
            <p>
              With over 6 years of experience in building scalable backend systems, I specialize 
              in creating robust APIs, optimizing database performance, and implementing DevOps 
              best practices. My passion lies in solving complex technical challenges and 
              building systems that can handle millions of users.

              "Handles millions of requests silently while everyone assumes it's magic."
            </div>
            <p>
              When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to 
              open-source projects, or sharing knowledge through technical blogs and mentoring.
